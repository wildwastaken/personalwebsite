## Allen Liu

Hi, my name is **Allen Liu**. I'm a software engineer primarily working on developing back-end applications and scripts.

In my down time, I'm a book worm, avid swimmer, and chess fanatic. This website will serve a hub for my creative output and project documentation.

Enjoy your time here.
