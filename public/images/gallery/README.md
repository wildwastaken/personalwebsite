# Photo Gallery

Drop your photos here!

## How to use:
1. Simply drag and drop your JPEG, JPG, PNG, or WebP images into this folder
2. The photos will automatically appear on your website at `/photos`
3. Images will be displayed in alphabetical order by filename

## Supported formats:
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.webp`

## Tips:
- Rename your files to something descriptive (e.g., `iceland-northern-lights.jpg`) - the filename will be used as the alt text
- Use hyphens or underscores instead of spaces in filenames
- For best results, use high-quality images (recommended: at least 1200px wide)
- The gallery uses a responsive masonry layout that adapts to different image sizes

## Example filenames:
- `cape-cod-sunset.jpg`
- `mountain-hiking-trip.jpg`
- `city-skyline-night.png`
